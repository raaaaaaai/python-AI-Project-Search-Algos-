# python-AI-Project-Search-Algos-

# This project is implemented using python.
# Front end is developed using tkinter 
# The search Algorithms that are implemented are as follow
# ASTAR
# BFS
# DFS
# UCS
# Bidirectional
# Depth Limited
# Iterative Deepning
# Best First Seacrh

# How to use it 

# Firstly check that your algorithms need Huristic or not 
# Like (BFS DFS ) dosent need huristic
# In first Column Ad the first node and in second ad the node you want to be its neighbour after that add cost and before pressing add node select from drop down menu that you want graph to 
# be directed or undirected because after that the option will be locked

# Add as many nodes using the above procedure and once you are done endter the starting node and end node after that select the algo you want to apply select it from the list 
# click the Submit button path will be generated.

# In case of huristic enter the node name and Add the huristic value after that click the Add Node huristic button.
